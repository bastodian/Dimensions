Gene Family Abundance Estimation
================================

Based on gene to PANTHER family ID mappings I created 187 gene family count files 
using a [script](https://github.com/bastodian/Dimensions/blob/master/Annotation/GeneFamily-Annotation/PantherAbundances/PantherAbundanceConvert.py) that sums RSEM counts from all genes predicted to belong to a gene family.

Transformed RSEM count files can be found [here](https://github.com/bastodian/Dimensions/tree/master/Annotation/GeneFamily-Annotation/PantherAbundances/GeneFamilyCounts).
The individual log file document which gene (comp_X_cX)was assigned to which gene
family (PTHR ID).
