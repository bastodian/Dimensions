Every folder contains the reslts of a DE analysis as decribed in the parent folder. edgeR subfolders
contain the R scripts that were run to generate the pdf plots and result summaries.

Examples:
[Rscript](https://github.com/bastodian/Dimensions/blob/master/DifferentialExpression-GO-Analysis/GeneFamilyLevelDE/DC12/edgeR_DC12vDC10/DC12vDC10.counts.matrix.condA_vs_condB.condA.vs.condB.EdgeR.Rscript)
